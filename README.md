# Diabetes Prediction with Neural Networks

## Description

This repository presents a machine learning workflow to predict the onset of diabetes using a publicly available tabular dataset. The project covers the entire process: data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, neural network model building (TensorFlow/Keras), training, and evaluation.

It is beginner-friendly and intended as a reference for applying deep learning to tabular healthcare data.
